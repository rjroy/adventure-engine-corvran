---

### GM Notes

**Enemy Tactics**:
- Archers focus fire on spellcasters and unarmored targets
- Warriors use Nimble Escape to Disengage after attacking, making them hard to pin down
- Snaggle stays adjacent to a warrior when possible to use Redirect Attack
- If two or more goblins fall, warriors become more defensive (Dodge action)
- Snaggle will flee toward the lair if reduced to 5 HP or fewer

**Secrets**:
- The "merchant" whose cart was overturned is actually hiding in the bushes 100 ft down the road, watching
- One goblin (Warrior 2) wears a silver ring worth 25 gp - stolen from a noble's courier last week

**Narrative Beats**:
- When Snaggle first appears: "A larger goblin in a crude crown of bones shrieks orders in Goblin, pointing a notched scimitar at you!"
- If Snaggle uses Redirect Attack: "The goblin boss shoves his underling into your blade's path at the last second!"
- When goblins flee: "The remaining goblins break and run, screeching in terror as they disappear into the undergrowth!"
- After combat: The hidden merchant emerges, offering a reward for recovering his goods
