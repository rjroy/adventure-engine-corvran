### Pact Magic Features

- **Short Rest Recovery**: Warlock spell slots recharge on Short Rest (not just Long Rest)
- **All Slots Same Level**: All Pact Magic slots are the same level
- **Maximum 5th Level**: Pact Magic slots cap at 5th level
- **Mystic Arcanum**: At levels 11, 13, 15, and 17, Warlocks gain one spell each of 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th level that can be cast once per Long Rest without a slot

## Spell Preparation

Different classes prepare spells in different ways.

### Spell Preparation by Class

| Class    | When to Change  | Number Changed |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Bard     | On level up     | One spell      |
| Cleric   | After Long Rest | Any number     |
| Druid    | After Long Rest | Any number     |
| Paladin  | After Long Rest | One spell      |
| Ranger   | After Long Rest | One spell      |
| Sorcerer | On level up     | One spell      |
| Warlock  | On level up     | One spell      |
| Wizard   | After Long Rest | Any number     |

### Prepared Spells Formula

For classes that prepare from a list:

**Cleric/Druid**: Wisdom modifier + class level (minimum 1)
**Paladin**: Charisma modifier + half Paladin level, rounded down (minimum 1)
**Wizard**: Intelligence modifier + Wizard level (minimum 1)

Bard, Ranger, Sorcerer, and Warlock have fixed numbers of spells known based on level (see class tables).

## Concentration Duration Limits

Common concentration spell durations:

| Duration | Example Spells |
|----------|----------------|
| Up to 1 round | True Strike |
| Up to 1 minute | Bless, Bane, Hex, Hunter's Mark |
| Up to 10 minutes | Detect Magic, Invisibility |
| Up to 1 hour | Fly, Haste, Greater Invisibility |
| Up to 8 hours | Dominate Monster |
| Up to 24 hours | Mage's Faithful Hound |

## Schools of Magic

| School | Typical Effects |
|--------|-----------------|
| Abjuration | Prevents or reverses harmful effects |
| Conjuration | Transports creatures or objects |
| Divination | Reveals information |
| Enchantment | Influences minds |
| Evocation | Channels energy to create effects (often destructive) |
| Illusion | Deceives the mind or senses |
| Necromancy | Manipulates life and death |
| Transmutation | Transforms creatures or objects |

## Multiclass Spellcasting

When multiclassing between spellcasting classes, spell slots are calculated differently:

1. **Full Caster Levels**: Add full levels from Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
2. **Half Caster Levels**: Add half levels (rounded down) from Paladin, Ranger
3. **Third Caster Levels**: Add one-third levels (rounded down) from Eldritch Knight Fighter, Arcane Trickster Rogue

Use the combined level to determine spell slots from the Full Caster table.

**Important**: Spells known/prepared are still determined separately for each class. A Wizard 5/Cleric 5 has the slots of a 10th-level caster but only knows/prepares spells as a 5th-level Wizard and 5th-level Cleric.
