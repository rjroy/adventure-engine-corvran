## Notes

### Personality Traits
I'm always polite and respectful, even to my enemies. I can stare down a hell hound without flinching.

### Ideals
Greater Good: Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others.

### Bonds
I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. My honor is my life.

### Flaws
I have little respect for anyone who isn't a proven warrior. I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost lives, and I would do anything to keep that secret.

### Backstory
Kira served in the city guard of Waterdeep for five years before a disastrous ambush claimed half her squad. Though she fought valiantly, she carries the guilt of those lost. She left the guard to seek redemption as an adventurer, hoping to save more lives than she failed to protect.
