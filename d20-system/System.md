## Ability Scores

All creatures have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics.

### The Six Abilities

| Ability      | Abbreviation | Measures                            |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Strength     | STR          | Physical might                      |
| Dexterity    | DEX          | Agility, reflexes, and balance      |
| Constitution | CON          | Health and stamina                  |
| Intelligence | INT          | Reasoning and memory                |
| Wisdom       | WIS          | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude |
| Charisma     | CHA          | Confidence, poise, and charm        |

### Ability Scores and Meanings

| Score   | Meaning                                |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| 1       | Lowest possible score                  |
| 2-9     | Below average capability               |
| 10-11   | Human average                          |
| 12-19   | Above average capability               |

| 30      | Absolute maximum                       |

### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier derived from its score using this formula:

**Modifier = (Score - 10) / 2** (rounded down)

| Score   | Modifier |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | -5       |
| 2-3     | -4       |
| 4-5     | -3       |
| 6-7     | -2       |

| 28-29   | +9       |
| 30      | +10      |

## D20 Tests

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests and come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

### Resolution Formula

**d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable) vs DC or AC**

### Steps to Resolve a D20 Test

1. **Roll 1d20.** You always want to roll high.

2. **Add Modifiers:**
   - The relevant ability modifier
   - Your Proficiency Bonus if you have proficiency in the relevant skill, save, or weapon
   - Any circumstantial bonuses or penalties from spells, features, or conditions

3. **Compare to Target Number:**
   - For ability checks and saving throws, compare to the Difficulty Class (DC)
   - For attack rolls, compare to the target's Armor Class (AC)
   - If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the test succeeds

### Difficulty Class Table

Use these standard DCs to set task difficulty:

| Task Difficulty   | DC |
|-------------------|----|
| Very Easy         | 5  |
| Easy              | 10 |
| Medium            | 15 |
| Hard              | 20 |
| Very Hard         | 25 |
| Nearly Impossible | 30 |

### Ability Checks

An ability check tests a creature's talent and training to overcome a challenge.

**Examples by Ability:**
- **Strength**: Lift, push, pull, or break something
- **Dexterity**: Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly
- **Constitution**: Push your body beyond normal limits
- **Intelligence**: Reason or remember
- **Wisdom**: Notice things in the environment or creature behavior
- **Charisma**: Influence, entertain, or deceive

### Saving Throws

A saving throw represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat.

**Examples by Ability:**
- **Strength**: Physically resist direct force
- **Dexterity**: Dodge out of harm's way
- **Constitution**: Endure a toxic hazard
- **Intelligence**: Recognize an illusion as fake
- **Wisdom**: Resist a mental assault
- **Charisma**: Assert your identity

### Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target.

**Ability Used by Attack Type:**
- **Strength**: Melee attacks with weapons or Unarmed Strikes
- **Dexterity**: Ranged attacks with weapons
- **Varies**: Spell attacks (determined by spellcasting ability)

### Rolling 20 or 1

- **Natural 20 on an attack roll**: Critical Hit. The attack hits regardless of AC.
- **Natural 1 on an attack roll**: Automatic miss regardless of modifiers.

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage reflects positive circumstances; Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.

### How It Works

When a D20 Test has Advantage or Disadvantage, roll two d20s instead of one:
- **Advantage**: Use the higher of the two rolls
- **Disadvantage**: Use the lower of the two rolls

### Key Rules

- **They Don't Stack**: Multiple sources of Advantage still mean rolling only two d20s. Same for Disadvantage.
- **They Cancel Out**: If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage (from any number of sources), they cancel out and you roll one d20.

### Interactions with Rerolls

When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and can reroll (such as with Heroic Inspiration), you can reroll only one of the two dice, not both.

---

## Heroic Inspiration

Heroic Inspiration is a reward the GM can give to recognize heroic, in-character, or entertaining play.

### Using Heroic Inspiration

If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it. You must use the new roll.

### Only One at a Time

You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something would give you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to another player character in your group who lacks it.

### Gaining Heroic Inspiration

Your GM can give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons:
- Doing something particularly heroic
- Acting true to your character
- Making the game more entertaining for everyone

Some character features grant Heroic Inspiration automatically. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration.

---

## Proficiency

Proficiency reflects training and experience. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus based on their level or Challenge Rating.

### Proficiency Bonus by Level/CR

| Level or CR | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-4         | +2                |
| 5-8         | +3                |
| 9-12        | +4                |
| 13-16       | +5                |
| 17-20       | +6                |
| 21-24       | +7                |
| 25-28       | +8                |
| 29-30       | +9                |

### When to Add Proficiency Bonus

Add your Proficiency Bonus to a D20 Test when:
- Making an ability check using a skill you're proficient in
- Making a saving throw you're proficient in
- Making an attack roll with a weapon you're proficient with
- Making a spell attack roll (spellcasters are proficient in their spell attacks)

### The Bonus Doesn't Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added more than once to a single die roll. If multiple proficiencies apply, add the bonus only once.

Some features (like Expertise) multiply the Proficiency Bonus for certain checks. The bonus can only be multiplied once and divided once per use.

---

---

## Combat

Combat organizes action into rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world.

### Combat Step by Step

1. **Establish Positions**: The GM determines where all characters and creatures are located.
2. **Roll Initiative**: Everyone rolls 1d20 + DEX modifier. Higher results act first.
3. **Take Turns**: Each participant acts in Initiative order. When everyone has acted, the round ends.
4. **Repeat**: Continue until one side is defeated, surrenders, or flees.

### Initiative

- Roll 1d20 + DEX modifier when combat starts
- **Surprise**: If unaware that combat is starting, roll Initiative with Disadvantage
- **Ties**: Players decide order among themselves; GM decides for monsters

### Your Turn

On your turn, you can:
- **Move** up to your Speed
- **Take one Action** (see Actions table)
- **Take one Bonus Action** (only if a feature grants one)
- **Interact** with one object for free (open door, draw weapon)

You can split movement before and after your action.

### Actions

| Action    | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Attack    | Make one weapon attack or Unarmed Strike |
| Dash      | Gain extra movement equal to your Speed |
| Disengage | Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks this turn |
| Dodge     | Attacks against you have Disadvantage; DEX saves have Advantage (until your next turn) |
| Help      | Give an ally Advantage on their next ability check or attack roll |
| Hide      | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to become hidden |
| Influence | Make a Charisma check to alter a creature's attitude |
| Magic     | Cast a spell or use a magic item |
| Ready     | Prepare an action to trigger on a specific condition (uses Reaction) |
| Search    | Make a Wisdom (Perception, Insight, or Survival) check |
| Study     | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) check |
| Utilize   | Use a nonmagical object |

### Reactions

You get one Reaction per round, which resets at the start of your turn. The most common Reaction is an Opportunity Attack.

### Movement and Position

- **Difficult Terrain**: Costs 1 extra foot per foot moved (rubble, undergrowth, stairs)
- **Moving Through Creatures**: You can move through allies, Incapacitated creatures, Tiny creatures, or creatures two sizes larger/smaller than you. You can't end your move in an occupied space. Non-ally spaces count as Difficult Terrain
- **Dropping Prone**: Free; standing up costs half your Speed

#### Creature Size and Space

| Size       | Space         |
|------------|---------------|
| Tiny       | 2½ × 2½ ft    |
| Small      | 5 × 5 ft      |
| Medium     | 5 × 5 ft      |
| Large      | 10 × 10 ft    |
| Huge       | 15 × 15 ft    |
| Gargantuan | 20 × 20 ft    |

### Making Attacks

1. **Choose a Target** within your attack's range
2. **Determine Modifiers**: Check for cover, Advantage/Disadvantage
3. **Roll Attack**: d20 + ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus vs target's AC
4. **Roll Damage** on hit: Weapon dice + ability modifier

### Cover

| Cover           | Benefit |
|-----------------|---------|
| Half            | +2 AC, +2 DEX saves (behind creature or object covering half) |
| Three-Quarters  | +5 AC, +5 DEX saves (behind object covering ¾) |
| Total           | Can't be targeted directly (fully concealed) |

### Ranged Attacks

- **Normal Range**: No penalty
- **Long Range**: Disadvantage on attack roll
- **Beyond Long Range**: Can't attack
- **Close Combat**: Disadvantage when enemy is within 5 feet (unless Incapacitated)

### Melee Attacks

- **Reach**: Most creatures have 5-foot reach; some weapons or creatures have longer reach
- **Unarmed Strike**: 1 + STR modifier bludgeoning damage

### Opportunity Attacks

When a creature you can see leaves your reach, you can use your Reaction to make one melee attack against it.

**Avoiding Opportunity Attacks**:
- Take the Disengage action
- Teleport
- Be moved by an external force (knocked back, carried)

---

## Damage and Healing

Injury and death are frequent threats in combat and dangerous situations.

### Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) represent durability and the will to live. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Current Hit Points range from 0 to your maximum.

When you take damage, subtract it from your current Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capabilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.

**Bloodied**: If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you're Bloodied. This has no effect on its own but may trigger other game effects.

### Damage Rolls

When you hit with an attack, roll the weapon's damage dice and add your ability modifier (the same modifier used for the attack roll).

**Formula**: Weapon dice + ability modifier

Spells specify their own damage dice and whether to add modifiers. Minimum damage is 0 (never negative).

### Critical Hits

When you score a Critical Hit (natural 20 on attack roll), roll the attack's damage dice twice, add them together, then add modifiers normally.

**Example**: Critical Hit with a Longsword (1d8 + STR) becomes 2d8 + STR.

If the attack includes extra damage dice (such as Sneak Attack), roll those dice twice as well.

### Damage Types

Each instance of damage has a type. Common damage types include:

| Physical | Elemental | Other |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Bludgeoning | Acid | Force |
| Piercing | Cold | Necrotic |
| Slashing | Fire | Poison |
| | Lightning | Psychic |
| | Thunder | Radiant |

Damage types have no inherent rules but interact with Resistance, Vulnerability, and Immunity.

### Resistance and Vulnerability

- **Resistance**: Damage of that type is halved (round down)
- **Vulnerability**: Damage of that type is doubled

**No Stacking**: Multiple instances of the same Resistance or Vulnerability count as one.

**Order of Application**:
1. Apply bonuses, penalties, and other multipliers first
2. Apply Resistance second (halve)
3. Apply Vulnerability third (double)

### Immunity

Immunity to a damage type means you take no damage of that type. Immunity to a condition means you aren't affected by it.

### Healing

Hit Points can be restored by magic (spells, potions) or resting.

When you receive healing, add the restored Hit Points to your current total. You can't exceed your Hit Point maximum—excess healing is lost.

**Example**: At 14 HP with 20 HP maximum, receiving 8 HP of healing restores only 6 HP (to reach the maximum of 20).

**Knocking Out**: When you reduce a creature to 0 HP with a melee attack, you can instead reduce it to 1 HP and give it the Unconscious condition.

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When you drop to 0 HP, you either die outright or fall Unconscious.

#### Instant Death

A creature dies instantly if:

- **Monster Death**: Monsters die at 0 HP (GM may override for specific monsters)
- **HP Maximum Reduced to 0**: Some effects drain life energy, reducing maximum HP
- **Massive Damage**: When damage reduces you to 0 HP and the remaining damage equals or exceeds your HP maximum

**Massive Damage Example**: At 6 HP with 12 HP maximum, taking 18 damage drops you to 0 HP with 12 damage remaining. Since 12 equals your maximum, you die instantly.

#### Falling Unconscious

If you reach 0 HP and don't die instantly, you gain the Unconscious condition and must make Death Saving Throws.

#### Death Saving Throws

At the start of each turn while at 0 HP, roll 1d20 (no modifiers):

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Two failures |
| 2-9 | One failure |
| 10-19 | One success |
| 20 | Regain 1 HP and consciousness |

**Three Successes**: You become Stable (see below)
**Three Failures**: You die

Successes and failures don't need to be consecutive. Both reset when you regain any HP or become Stable.

**Damage at 0 HP**: Taking damage while at 0 HP causes one Death Saving Throw failure (two failures if from a Critical Hit). If the damage equals or exceeds your HP maximum, you die.

#### Stabilizing a Character

A creature can use the Help action to stabilize someone at 0 HP by making a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

A Stable creature:
- Doesn't make Death Saving Throws
- Remains Unconscious
- Regains 1 HP after 1d4 hours if not healed

Taking damage ends the Stable condition and restarts Death Saving Throws.

### Temporary Hit Points

Some effects grant Temporary Hit Points, which act as a buffer against damage.

**Lose Temporary HP First**: When you take damage, Temporary HP are lost before actual HP.

**Example**: With 5 Temporary HP, taking 7 damage loses all 5 Temporary HP and 2 actual HP.

**Duration**: Until depleted or you finish a Long Rest.

**They Don't Stack**: If you gain Temporary HP while you already have some, choose to keep either the old or new amount (don't add them).

**Not Real HP**: Temporary HP can't be healed, don't count as healing, and don't restore you to consciousness at 0 HP.

### Resting

Rest allows creatures to recover.

**Short Rest** (1 hour):
- Can spend Hit Dice to regain HP
- Some abilities recharge on Short Rest

**Long Rest** (8 hours, at least 6 hours sleeping):
- Regain all lost HP
- Regain spent Hit Dice (up to half your total)
- Some abilities recharge on Long Rest
- Can't benefit from more than one Long Rest per 24 hours

---

## Quick Reference

### Core Formula
**d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient) vs DC or AC**

### Modifier Calculation
**(Ability Score - 10) / 2** rounded down

### Common DCs
- Easy task: DC 10
- Medium task: DC 15
- Hard task: DC 20

### Advantage/Disadvantage
- Roll 2d20, take higher (Advantage) or lower (Disadvantage)
- Multiple sources don't stack
- Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out

---

## Experience and Advancement

Characters gain Experience Points (XP) by overcoming challenges. When your XP total reaches a threshold, you gain a level.

### Character Advancement Table

| Level | XP Required | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1     | 0           | +2                |
| 2     | 300         | +2                |
| 3     | 900         | +2                |
| 4     | 2,700       | +2                |
| 5     | 6,500       | +3                |
| 6     | 14,000      | +3                |
| 7     | 23,000      | +3                |
| 8     | 34,000      | +3                |
| 9     | 48,000      | +4                |
| 10    | 64,000      | +4                |
| 11    | 85,000      | +4                |
| 12    | 100,000     | +4                |
| 13    | 120,000     | +5                |
| 14    | 140,000     | +5                |
| 15    | 165,000     | +5                |
| 16    | 195,000     | +5                |
| 17    | 225,000     | +6                |
| 18    | 265,000     | +6                |
| 19    | 305,000     | +6                |
| 20    | 355,000     | +6                |

### Gaining a Level

When you reach enough XP to level up:

1. **Roll Hit Points**: Roll your class's Hit Die + CON modifier (minimum 1), add to HP maximum. Alternatively, use the fixed value: (die average + 1) + CON modifier.

2. **Record New Features**: Check your class table for features gained at this level. Make any choices offered (subclass, spells known, fighting style, etc.).

3. **Update Proficiency Bonus**: If your Proficiency Bonus increased (see table above), update all numbers that include it: attack bonuses, saving throws, skill checks, spell save DC.

4. **Ability Score Improvements**: At certain levels (typically 4, 8, 12, 16, 19), you may increase ability scores or take a feat. Update modifiers and derived values accordingly.
