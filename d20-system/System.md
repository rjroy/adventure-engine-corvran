## Ability Scores

All creatures have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics.

### The Six Abilities

| Ability      | Abbreviation | Measures                            |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Strength     | STR          | Physical might                      |
| Dexterity    | DEX          | Agility, reflexes, and balance      |
| Constitution | CON          | Health and stamina                  |
| Intelligence | INT          | Reasoning and memory                |
| Wisdom       | WIS          | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude |
| Charisma     | CHA          | Confidence, poise, and charm        |

### Ability Scores and Meanings

| Score   | Meaning                                |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| 1       | Lowest possible score                  |
| 2-9     | Below average capability               |
| 10-11   | Human average                          |

| 30      | Absolute maximum                       |

### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier derived from its score using this formula:

**Modifier = (Score - 10) / 2** (rounded down)

| Score   | Modifier |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | -5       |
| 2-3     | -4       |

## D20 Tests

When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a d20 roll to determine success or failure. These rolls are called D20 Tests and come in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

### Resolution Formula

**d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable) vs DC or AC**

### Steps to Resolve a D20 Test

1. **Roll 1d20.** You always want to roll high.

2. **Add Modifiers:**
   - The relevant ability modifier
   - Your Proficiency Bonus if you have proficiency in the relevant skill, save, or weapon
   - Any circumstantial bonuses or penalties from spells, features, or conditions

3. **Compare to Target Number:**
   - For ability checks and saving throws, compare to the Difficulty Class (DC)
   - For attack rolls, compare to the target's Armor Class (AC)
   - If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the test succeeds

### Difficulty Class Table

Use these standard DCs to set task difficulty:

| Task Difficulty   | DC |
|-------------------|----|
| Very Easy         | 5  |
| Easy              | 10 |
| Medium            | 15 |
| Hard              | 20 |
| Very Hard         | 25 |
| Nearly Impossible | 30 |

### Ability Checks

An ability check tests a creature's talent and training to overcome a challenge.

**Examples by Ability:**
- **Strength**: Lift, push, pull, or break something
- **Dexterity**: Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly
- **Constitution**: Push your body beyond normal limits
- **Intelligence**: Reason or remember
- **Wisdom**: Notice things in the environment or creature behavior
- **Charisma**: Influence, entertain, or deceive

### Saving Throws

A saving throw represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat.

**Examples by Ability:**
- **Strength**: Physically resist direct force
- **Dexterity**: Dodge out of harm's way
- **Constitution**: Endure a toxic hazard
- **Intelligence**: Recognize an illusion as fake
- **Wisdom**: Resist a mental assault
- **Charisma**: Assert your identity

### Attack Rolls

An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target.

**Ability Used by Attack Type:**
- **Strength**: Melee attacks with weapons or Unarmed Strikes
- **Dexterity**: Ranged attacks with weapons
- **Varies**: Spell attacks (determined by spellcasting ability)

### Rolling 20 or 1

- **Natural 20 on an attack roll**: Critical Hit. The attack hits regardless of AC.
- **Natural 1 on an attack roll**: Automatic miss regardless of modifiers.

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage reflects positive circumstances; Disadvantage reflects negative circumstances.

### How It Works

When a D20 Test has Advantage or Disadvantage, roll two d20s instead of one:
- **Advantage**: Use the higher of the two rolls
- **Disadvantage**: Use the lower of the two rolls

### Key Rules

- **They Don't Stack**: Multiple sources of Advantage still mean rolling only two d20s. Same for Disadvantage.
- **They Cancel Out**: If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage (from any number of sources), they cancel out and you roll one d20.

### Interactions with Rerolls

When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and can reroll (such as with Heroic Inspiration), you can reroll only one of the two dice, not both.

---

## Heroic Inspiration

Heroic Inspiration is a reward the GM can give to recognize heroic, in-character, or entertaining play.

### Using Heroic Inspiration

If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it to reroll any die immediately after rolling it. You must use the new roll.

### Only One at a Time

You can never have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something would give you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, you can give it to another player character in your group who lacks it.

### Gaining Heroic Inspiration

Your GM can give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons:
- Doing something particularly heroic
- Acting true to your character
- Making the game more entertaining for everyone

Some character features grant Heroic Inspiration automatically. For example, Human characters start each day with Heroic Inspiration.

---

## Proficiency

Proficiency reflects training and experience. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus based on their level or Challenge Rating.

### Proficiency Bonus by Level/CR

| Level or CR | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-4         | +2                |
| 5-8         | +3                |
| 9-12        | +4                |
| 13-16       | +5                |
| 17-20       | +6                |
| 21-24       | +7                |
| 25-28       | +8                |
| 29-30       | +9                |

### When to Add Proficiency Bonus

Add your Proficiency Bonus to a D20 Test when:
- Making an ability check using a skill you're proficient in
- Making a saving throw you're proficient in
- Making an attack roll with a weapon you're proficient with
- Making a spell attack roll (spellcasters are proficient in their spell attacks)

### The Bonus Doesn't Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added more than once to a single die roll. If multiple proficiencies apply, add the bonus only once.

Some features (like Expertise) multiply the Proficiency Bonus for certain checks. The bonus can only be multiplied once and divided once per use.

---

### Gaining a Level

When you reach enough XP to level up:

1. **Roll Hit Points**: Roll your class's Hit Die + CON modifier (minimum 1), add to HP maximum. Alternatively, use the fixed value: (die average + 1) + CON modifier.

2. **Record New Features**: Check your class table for features gained at this level. Make any choices offered (subclass, spells known, fighting style, etc.).

3. **Update Proficiency Bonus**: If your Proficiency Bonus increased (see table above), update all numbers that include it: attack bonuses, saving throws, skill checks, spell save DC.

4. **Ability Score Improvements**: At certain levels (typically 4, 8, 12, 16, 19), you may increase ability scores or take a feat. Update modifiers and derived values accordingly.
