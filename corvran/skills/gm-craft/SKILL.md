# GM Craft Techniques

Advanced storytelling techniques synthesized from actual-play productions (Critical Role, Dimension 20, The Adventure Zone), published GM guides (Dungeon World, FATE, Daggerheart), and community wisdom.

## Handling Failure (Fail Forward)

When a player fails a roll, avoid dead ends. Use one of these techniques:

### Succeed at a Cost
They achieve the goal but with complications:
- Lock picking: Door opens, but tools break or alarm triggers
- Persuasion: Noble agrees, but demands a favor in return
- Stealth: You slip past, but drop something important behind

### Fail Forward
They don't succeed, but something moves the story:
- Persuasion fail: Noble refuses, but reveals useful information in anger
- Investigation fail: You find nothing, but the crime scene's owner returns
- Stealth fail: You're spotted, but you choose whether to run, fight, or bluff

### When to Use Real Failures
Not every failure should be softened. Use hard failures when:
- Stakes were clearly communicated beforehand
- Failure creates interesting story (not dead ends)
- Success was already achieved "at a cost" recently
- The consequence is survivable and creates new choices

## Giving Narrative Authority

Hand control to players at dramatic moments.

### "How Do You Want To Do This?"
When a player lands a killing blow:
- Pause and ask: "How do you want to do this?"
- Let them describe their victory in their own words
- This rewards combat success with creative freedom
- Creates memorable moments players will recount

### Extend the Principle
Offer narrative authority for:
- Critical successes on skill checks
- Dramatic character entrances
- Signature moves or abilities
- Meaningful character moments (reunions, farewells, revelations)

### The Balance
GM describes the world's reaction; player describes their character's action.
- Player: "I spin and drive my blade through its heart"
- GM: "The creature shudders, its eyes going dark as it collapses"

## NPC Creation (Motivation-First)

Before appearance, voice, or abilities, define: **What does this NPC want?**

### The Core Question
NPCs with clear desires generate their own behavior:
- A merchant who wants to retire asks about the party's valuables
- A guard who wants excitement volunteers for dangerous missions
- A priest who wants validation offers advice even when unwanted

### Secondary Elements
After motivation, add one distinctive marker:
- **Verbal tic**: "You understand?" / Always sighs before speaking / Never uses names
- **Physical gesture**: Drums fingers / Adjusts glasses / Looks over your shoulder
- **Speech pattern**: Overly formal / Unfinished sentences / Questions everything

### Track Relationships
NPCs remember how players treated them:
- The merchant who was cheated grows hostile
- The guard who was bribed becomes a recurring contact
- The noble who was embarrassed plots revenge

World reactivity through NPC memory makes player choices feel consequential.

## Scene Pacing

### Cut at Plateau Moments
End scenes before they naturally conclude:
- The essential dramatic beat has landed
- Players have made their key decision
- Tension is at its peak (cliffhanger cuts)

**Good cut**: "Just as your blade meets theirs—meanwhile, in the throne room..."
**Bad cut**: Letting the scene wind down with smalltalk after the action

### Transitions
Use explicit transitions to move the story:
- "Meanwhile..." (parallel action)
- "As you travel..." (time compression)
- "Later that evening..." (skip to next beat)
- "The next morning brings..." (new day, new energy)

### Tension and Release Cycles
Alternate intensity levels:
- High: Combat, tense negotiations, chase scenes, revelations
- Low: Shopping, travel, camp conversations, downtime

Comedy doesn't undermine drama—it contrasts with it. A funny moment before a serious one makes both hit harder.

### Escalation
Let situations get worse before they resolve:
- Don't solve problems too quickly
- Add complications mid-scene ("The rope catches fire!")
- Let multiple threats compound
- Give players reasons to struggle

## Improv Principles

The response spectrum for player proposals:

| Response | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **"Yes, and..."** | Idea enriches the scene—accept and expand |
| **"Yes, but..."** | Idea works with complications—add tension |
| **"No, but..."** | Idea doesn't fit—offer an alternative |
| **"You can certainly try"** | Outcome uncertain—signal high stakes |

**Reframe rather than reject:** When a player's idea doesn't quite work, find a version that does. Preserve their investment while maintaining world integrity.

> See `references/improv-techniques.md` for extended examples and common pitfalls.

## Collaborative Worldbuilding

Players aren't just acting in your world—they help create it.

### Ask and Incorporate
Invite players to define details:
- "What god does your character worship? Tell me about them."
- "Your character knows a fence in this city—who are they?"
- "You've been to this tavern before. What do you remember about it?"

### Steal Player Theories
When players speculate about mysteries:
- Listen to their theories
- If their idea is better than yours, use it
- They'll feel clever for "figuring it out"
- The story improves from collective creativity

### Draw Maps, Leave Blanks
Don't fully define everything:
- Leave space for discovery
- Let some questions remain unanswered
- The world grows through play, not just prep

### Shared Ownership
The world belongs to everyone:
- GM provides situations and NPCs
- Players provide protagonists and choices
- Story emerges from interaction
- Neither side controls it entirely

---

## The Essential Reminder

**The players are the protagonists of their story.** Your role is to:

1. Present situations and information
2. Ask questions that invite player action
3. Respond to player choices with consistent consequences
4. Never assume, declare, or control player character thoughts, feelings, or actions

The game exists in the conversation between GM and players. You describe the world; they describe their characters' responses to it. When this boundary is respected, players feel ownership over their characters and investment in the emerging story.

Being a Game Master is an act of service—using authority and creative power to make player wishes come true.
