# Failure Handling Examples

Concrete before/after comparisons for handling failed rolls.

---

## Succeed at a Cost

The player achieves their goal, but with complications.

### Stealth Check Failed

**Dead End (avoid):**
> "You fail to sneak past. The guards spot you."

**Succeed at a Cost:**
> "You slip past the guards, but in your haste, your coin pouch catches on a nail and tears open. Coins scatter across the stone floor behind you. You're through—but they'll know someone was here."

### Persuasion Check Failed

**Dead End (avoid):**
> "The noble isn't convinced. She refuses to help."

**Succeed at a Cost:**
> "Lady Vance sighs and slides the documents across the table. 'Fine. But you owe me now, and I collect my debts.' She writes something in a small black book. What do you do?"

### Athletics Check Failed

**Dead End (avoid):**
> "You can't make the jump. You fall."

**Succeed at a Cost:**
> "You land on the far ledge, but your ankle twists badly on impact. You're across—but you'll be moving at half speed until you can rest. The guards are getting closer."

## Fail Forward

The player doesn't succeed, but the story moves.

### Investigation Check Failed

**Dead End (avoid):**
> "You search the room but find nothing useful."

**Fail Forward:**
> "You're still searching when you hear footsteps in the hall. The door handle begins to turn. You've found nothing—but someone's about to find you."

### Deception Check Failed

**Dead End (avoid):**
> "The merchant doesn't believe your story. He refuses to talk."

**Fail Forward:**
> "The merchant's eyes narrow. 'You're lying. I've heard that exact story before—from the people who burned down my brother's shop.' He reaches under the counter. 'You're working with them, aren't you?'"

### Arcana Check Failed

**Dead End (avoid):**
> "You can't identify the magical effect."

**Fail Forward:**
> "The runes resist your analysis, their meaning slipping away like water through fingers. But as you study them, one symbol triggers a memory—you've seen this mark before. In your mentor's journal. The one she burned before she disappeared."

## Hard Failures (When to Use Them)

Sometimes failure should have real consequences.

### When Hard Failure Works

**Stakes were clear:**
> "You knew the rope was fraying. You jumped anyway. The rope snaps, and you fall twenty feet into the darkness below. Take 2d6 damage."

**Creates interesting choices:**
> "Your lockpicks break in the lock. The mechanism is jammed now—no one is picking this door. You'll need another way in, or to explain why you were trying to break into the baron's study."

**Consequence is survivable:**
> "The poison takes hold. You're not dying, but you're weakened—disadvantage on Strength checks until you find an antidote or take a long rest. The assassin smirks and vanishes into the crowd."

### When to Avoid Hard Failure

- Player had no warning about the stakes
- Failure creates a dead end with no options
- You just used "succeed at a cost" for the same player
- The consequence removes player agency entirely

## The Spectrum Applied

Same situation, different approaches:

**Scenario:** Player tries to climb a crumbling tower.

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Success** | "You scale the tower without incident and reach the top." |
| **Succeed at Cost** | "You reach the top, but dislodge stones on the way. The guards below look up at the noise." |
| **Fail Forward** | "The handholds crumble. You slide back down—but notice a hidden door at the base you missed before." |
| **Hard Failure** | "The stones give way. Take 1d6 damage as you tumble to the ground. The tower is unclimbable from this side." |

Choose based on: narrative stakes, recent outcomes, player investment, and what creates the most interesting next moment.
