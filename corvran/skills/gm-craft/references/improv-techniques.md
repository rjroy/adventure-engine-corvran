# Improv Techniques for GMs

Expanded examples and applications of core improv principles.

## The Response Spectrum

Every player proposal can be answered along a spectrum:

| Response | When to Use | Effect |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| "Yes, and..." | Idea enriches the scene | Builds momentum, rewards creativity |
| "Yes, but..." | Idea works with complications | Adds tension, maintains challenge |
| "No, but..." | Idea doesn't fit, alternative exists | Redirects without shutting down |
| "You can certainly try" | Outcome uncertain, stakes high | Builds suspense, honors agency |

## "Yes, And..." Examples

Accept and expand the player's contribution.

**Exploration:**
- Player: "I check if the statue has a hidden compartment"
- GM: "Yes, and when you press the gemstone eye, you hear gears grinding somewhere beneath the floor"

**Social:**
- Player: "I try to find common ground with the merchant by mentioning I'm also from the coast"
- GM: "Yes, and her eyes light up—turns out she knows your hometown's famous fishmonger"

**Investigation:**
- Player: "I look for tracks leading away from the crime scene"
- GM: "Yes, and you find two sets—one hurried, one dragging something heavy"

---

## "Yes, But..." Examples

Accept with complications from world logic.

**Environmental:**
- Player: "I want to swim across the underground river"
- GM: "Yes, but the current is stronger than it looks—you'll need to make a check or be pulled downstream"

**Social:**
- Player: "I want to bribe the guard"
- GM: "Yes, but he glances nervously at the captain watching from the tower—it'll cost more than usual"

**Combat:**
- Player: "I charge across the bridge at them"
- GM: "Yes, but the rotten planks crack under your weight—you'll need to move carefully or risk falling"

---

## "No, But..." Examples

Reject while offering alternatives.

**Mechanical limits:**
- Player: "Can I cast Fireball at 1st level?"
- GM: "No, but you could use Burning Hands—it's smaller but might still catch both of them"

**World logic:**
- Player: "I want to intimidate the dragon into leaving"
- GM: "No, ancient dragons don't fear mortals, but you might convince it you're more trouble than you're worth"

**Narrative consistency:**
- Player: "Can I recognize the assassin from my backstory?"
- GM: "No, you've never seen this one, but the tattoo on their wrist matches the guild that killed your mentor"

## "You Can Certainly Try"

Use when:
- Success is possible but unlikely
- The attempt itself creates story
- You want to signal high stakes without forbidding

**Examples:**
- Player: "I try to leap across the 30-foot chasm"
- GM: "You can certainly try. What's your plan?"

- Player: "I attempt to pickpocket the king during the audience"
- GM: "You can certainly try. You notice two guards watching him closely..."

**The key:** This phrase invites the player to commit or reconsider without GM judgment. It puts the choice back in their hands.

## Reframing Techniques

When a player's idea doesn't quite work, find a version that does.

**Preserve the intent:**
- Player wants: "I shoot the chandelier to drop it on them"
- Problem: No chandelier in this room
- Reframe: "No chandelier here, but you notice the rotted ceiling beams directly above them..."

**Shift the scale:**
- Player wants: "I convince the whole crowd to rise up against the tyrant"
- Problem: Too ambitious for one check
- Reframe: "You can't sway everyone at once, but you might win over that group of disgruntled guards in the corner..."

**Change the timing:**
- Player wants: "I prepare an ambush while they're talking"
- Problem: They're already being watched
- Reframe: "You can't set up now without being seen, but if you create a distraction first..."

## Common Pitfalls

**Over-using "Yes, and..."**
- Consequence: World loses consistency, stakes diminish
- Fix: Use "Yes, but..." to maintain challenge

**Defaulting to "No"**
- Consequence: Players stop proposing creative solutions
- Fix: Find the "but..." that makes their idea partially work

**"You can certainly try" as deflection**
- Consequence: Players feel unsupported, stop engaging
- Fix: Use it genuinely, then respond meaningfully to their attempt
