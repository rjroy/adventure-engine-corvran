## Domain Card Structure

All domain cards follow a consistent format:

### Card Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Level** | 1-10, determines when available during advancement |
| **Domain** | Which domain the card belongs to |
| **Recall Cost** | Stress spent to swap this card from vault to loadout mid-session |
| **Title** | The card's name |
| **Type** | One of: **abilities** (non-magical), **spells** (magical), or **grimoires** (Codex only) |
| **Feature** | What happens when the card is activated |

### Loadout & Vault

- **Loadout**: Up to 5 domain cards you can actively use
- **Vault**: Inactive cards; swap to loadout by paying Recall Cost in Stress
- At start of rest: swap freely between loadout and vault (no cost)

---

## Spellcast Roll Reference

Many domain cards require a Spellcast Roll - a standard Duality Dice action roll.

### Roll Formula
```
DdD + Spellcast Trait (from subclass) vs. Difficulty
```

### Spellcast Trait

Your **Spellcast Trait** is determined by your **subclass**, not your class. Check your subclass's Foundation card for your specific trait. Common patterns:

| Subclass Type | Typical Spellcast Trait |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Bard subclasses | Presence |
| Druid subclasses | Instinct |
| Seraph subclasses | Presence |
| Sorcerer subclasses | Presence |
| Wizard subclasses | Knowledge |

### Spellcast Outcomes

Standard action roll interpretation applies:
- **Critical**: Both dice match - automatic success with enhanced effect
- **Success with Hope**: Total >= Difficulty, hope die higher
- **Success with Fear**: Total >= Difficulty, fear die higher
- **Failure with Hope**: Total < Difficulty, hope die higher
- **Failure with Fear**: Total < Difficulty, fear die higher
