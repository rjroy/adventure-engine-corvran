# Campaign Frame Structure

This document explains each section of a Daggerheart campaign frame in detail, providing guidance for both using existing frames and creating custom ones.

## Frame Name and Tagline

The frame name should be evocative and memorable. The tagline (in italics) captures the central tension or premise in a single sentence.

**Good taglines**:
- Establish conflict or stakes
- Hint at the unique setting element
- Create intrigue without spoiling

**Example**: *"When an invading nation attacks an ancient forest deity, a virulent overgrowth spreads throughout the land."*

## Complexity Rating

Complexity ratings help groups choose frames appropriate to their experience level:

| Rating | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| ● | Minimal mechanical changes. The frame is primarily narrative, using standard Daggerheart rules with thematic guidance. | New groups, one-shots, lighter play |
| ●● | Moderate mechanical additions. Introduces 1-2 new subsystems or modifies existing rules in limited ways. | Groups comfortable with core rules |
| ●●● | Significant mechanical complexity. Multiple new systems that interact with each other and core rules. | Experienced groups seeking crunch |

## The Pitch

The pitch is a **player-facing** introduction read aloud before session zero. It should:

- Be 2-3 sentences maximum
- Establish the setting's unique hook
- Describe what characters will be doing
- Create buy-in without overwhelming detail
- Use evocative language that sets tone

**Write the pitch in second person** ("you'll play...") to help players imagine themselves in the world.

## Tone & Feel

A comma-separated list of 5-7 adjectives describing the emotional atmosphere. These guide:

- How the GM describes scenes
- What kind of moments to create
- Player expectations for roleplay

**Common tone adjectives**:
- Adventurous, Bleak, Comedic, Dark, Epic, Gritty, Heroic, Hopeful, Horrific, Lighthearted, Melancholic, Mysterious, Romantic, Tense, Thrilling, Tragic, Uncanny, Whimsical

Mix tones for nuance: "Dark, Hopeful, Uncanny" suggests horror with redemption themes.

## Themes

Themes are the narrative tensions and questions the campaign explores. Good themes:

- Present genuine tensions without easy answers
- Connect to character choices
- Drive conflict at multiple scales (personal, faction, world)
- Can evolve as the campaign progresses

**Theme formats**:
- Single concepts: *Redemption, Survival, Identity*
- Tensions: *Freedom vs. Security, Nature vs. Civilization*
- Questions: *What makes someone a hero?*

List 3-6 themes. Too many dilutes focus; too few limits story potential.

## Touchstones

Media references that capture the frame's vibe. Include:

- 3-5 references across different media (film, books, games, TV)
- Works that share tone, themes, or aesthetic
- Mix well-known and niche references

Touchstones help players and GMs quickly align expectations. If someone hasn't experienced a touchstone, they can seek it out for inspiration.

## Overview

The overview is **GM-facing** background shared with players before character creation. Structure it as:

1. **The Before**: What was the world like before current events?
2. **The Inciting Change**: What happened to create the current crisis?
3. **The Current State**: What is life like now?
4. **The Factions**: Who are the major players and what do they want?
5. **Why Characters Matter**: What role will PCs play?

Length: 3-6 paragraphs. Dense enough to establish the world, concise enough to read in one sitting.

## Communities

For each SRD community that has unique aspects in this frame:

1. **Context**: How does this community exist in the setting?
2. **Unique aspects**: What's different about them here?
3. **Session zero questions**: 2-3 questions connecting characters to the frame

Questions should:
- Reference frame-specific elements
- Create hooks for future story
- Establish relationships or backstory
- Vary in emotional weight

Not every community needs coverage. Focus on those with significant differences.

## Ancestries

Similar to communities, but focus on:

- Physical or cultural differences in this setting
- How frame events have affected this ancestry
- Any mechanical implications (rare)

Keep ancestry sections brief unless major changes apply.

## Classes

Describe how each class fits the setting:

- Where do they come from? (institutions, traditions, origins)
- What role do they play in current events?
- How might players connect their class to factions?

Group related classes together (e.g., "Warriors and Wizards" if both relate to the same institution).

## Player Principles

3-4 principles guiding player roleplay. Each principle should:

- Have a clear, memorable name
- Explain what it means in 2-3 sentences
- Connect to frame themes
- Encourage specific types of scenes or choices

**Good player principles**:
- Encourage vulnerability and emotional engagement
- Push characters into frame-appropriate conflicts
- Create opportunities for memorable moments

## GM Principles

3-4 principles guiding GM narration. Each should:

- Have a clear, memorable name
- Provide actionable guidance
- Help maintain tonal consistency
- Suggest specific techniques

**Good GM principles**:
- Guide NPC portrayal
- Shape challenge design
- Reinforce themes through world response
- Balance opposing tones (e.g., horror and hope)

## Distinctions

Distinctions are unique setting elements that make this frame special. Each distinction should:

- Have a memorable name
- Explain what it is and how it works
- Describe its impact on daily life
- Suggest potential complications or story hooks

**Types of distinctions**:
- **Cosmological**: Different time, seasons, celestial bodies
- **Geographic**: Unique terrain, magical locations
- **Social**: Unusual customs, power structures, relationships
- **Supernatural**: Magic systems, divine beings, curses
- **Technological**: Unusual tech levels, specific inventions

Distinctions can have mechanical implications. If so, explain clearly.

## The Inciting Incident

The scenario that launches the campaign. Include:

1. **The situation**: What's happening right now?
2. **Key NPCs**: 2-3 characters who set events in motion
3. **The hook**: Why are the PCs involved?
4. **Initial direction**: Where do they go first?

The inciting incident should:
- Connect to frame themes immediately
- Give clear initial objectives
- Leave room for player agency
- Introduce major factions or conflicts

Provide an example incident but note GMs can create their own.

## Campaign Mechanics

Special rules unique to this frame. For each mechanic:

1. **Name**: Clear, thematic name
2. **Trigger**: What causes this mechanic to activate?
3. **Procedure**: Step-by-step how it works
4. **Consequences**: What happens as a result?
5. **Tokens/Tracking**: Any resources involved

Keep mechanics:
- Simple enough to remember
- Thematically resonant
- Integrated with core Daggerheart rules
- Tested for balance (if possible)

## Session Zero Questions

Questions for players to answer during session zero. Include:

- 4-8 general questions any character might answer
- Community/ancestry/class-specific questions in those sections

**Question types**:
- World-building: Players define setting details
- Relationship: Connections to NPCs or other PCs
- Backstory: Personal history relevant to themes
- Stakes: What does the character fear losing?
- Secrets: Hidden aspects that may emerge in play

Questions should be open-ended, avoiding yes/no answers.
