# Experience Template

<!--
  DAGGERHEART EXPERIENCE TEMPLATE
  ===============================
  Experiences represent your character's background and training.
  Each Experience provides a modifier when its scope applies to an action.

  CRITICAL: Use bounded constraints to prevent semantic drift.
  - Define explicit positive scope (when it applies)
  - Define explicit exclusions (when it does NOT apply)
  - When scope is unclear, default to NOT applying the bonus
-->

## Experience: [Name]

**Modifier**: +[1-3]

<!--
  MODIFIER GUIDELINES
  ===================
  +1: Minor background element, limited applicability
  +2: Significant training or extensive background
  +3: Defining expertise, central to character identity
-->

**Narrative Origin**: [How did you acquire this experience?]

<!--
  NARRATIVE ORIGIN
  ================
  Briefly describe how your character gained this experience.
  This helps establish the scope and provides narrative hooks.
-->

> [Player's brief answer - 1-3 sentences describing the experience's origin]

**Applies When**:

<!--
  POSITIVE SCOPE
  ==============
  List specific situations where this Experience applies.
  Be concrete and actionable. The GM uses this to decide if
  the bonus applies to a given action roll.

  Good examples:
  - "Navigating at sea or by stars"
  - "Recognizing military tactics or formations"
  - "Picking locks on mechanical doors"

  Avoid vague scope:
  - "When being clever" (too broad)
  - "In dangerous situations" (too broad)
  - "When it makes sense" (no guidance)
-->

- [Specific situation 1]
- [Specific situation 2]
- [Specific situation 3]
- [Specific situation 4]

**Does NOT Apply**:

<!--
  EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS
  ===================
  List situations that might seem related but are excluded.
  This prevents scope creep and semantic drift.

  The goal is to pre-answer "but wouldn't it also apply to...?"
  questions before they arise during play.

  Good examples:
  - "General combat (use class features instead)"
  - "Social situations not involving criminals"
  - "Magic or supernatural phenomena"
  - "Knowledge of landlocked regions"
-->

- [Explicit exclusion 1]
- [Explicit exclusion 2]
- [Explicit exclusion 3]

## Example: Former Pirate

**Modifier**: +2

**Narrative Origin**: Five years sailing with the Salt Vipers

> I learned to read the stars, tie knots that hold, and spot a mark. The Captain trusted me at the helm during night raids, and I never once ran us aground.

**Applies When**:
- Navigation at sea or by stars
- Rope work, rigging, and sailing maneuvers
- Identifying valuables or potential marks
- Understanding pirate codes, signals, and customs
- Swimming and water-based movement

**Does NOT Apply**:
- General combat (use class features)
- Social situations not involving criminals or sailors
- Knowledge of landlocked regions or overland travel
- Magic or supernatural phenomena
- Legitimate maritime law or naval protocols

## Example: Exiled Scholar

**Modifier**: +2

**Narrative Origin**: Ten years studying forbidden texts at the Obsidian Library

> The Library held knowledge others feared to preserve. I catalogued apocalypse prophecies, demon bindings, and the journals of mad wizards. They exiled me for asking why such knowledge was kept at all.

**Applies When**:
- Recalling obscure or forbidden lore
- Recognizing magical symbols, ritual components, or arcane writing
- Researching in libraries or archives
- Identifying dangerous magical phenomena
- Understanding the motivations of those who seek forbidden power

**Does NOT Apply**:
- Practical spellcasting (knowing about magic is not casting it)
- Physical tasks or combat
- Current events or recent history (my knowledge is ancient)
- Social graces (scholars are awkward)
- Anything requiring physical books I don't have access to

---

## Example: Wilderness Guide

**Modifier**: +1

**Narrative Origin**: Grew up leading merchant caravans through the Thornwood

> Every trail through the Thornwood has its dangers. I learned which berries heal and which kill, which animal sounds mean "run," and how to find water when the maps lie.

**Applies When**:
- Tracking creatures or people through wilderness
- Foraging for food and water
- Navigating without roads or maps
- Recognizing dangerous flora and fauna

**Does NOT Apply**:
- Urban environments or dungeons
- Combat (I avoid fights, not seek them)
- Arcane or supernatural tracking
- Regions outside temperate forests (my knowledge is specific)

## GM Guidance for Experiences

### When a Player Wants to Apply an Experience

1. **Check Positive Scope**: Does the action clearly fall within the listed "Applies When" situations?
2. **Check Exclusions**: Is this action covered by "Does NOT Apply"?
3. **When Unclear**: Default to NOT applying the bonus

### Preventing Scope Creep

Experiences are bounded permissions, not general traits. A "Former Pirate" does not get a bonus to:
- All charisma checks (only those involving criminals/sailors)
- All combat (only when the specific Experience situation applies)
- All knowledge checks (only pirate-related knowledge)

### Creating New Experiences During Play

If a player wants to create a new Experience based on adventure events:
1. Define the narrative origin (what happened)
2. Define 3-5 specific situations where it applies
3. Define 2-3 explicit exclusions
4. Assign modifier based on significance (+1 minor, +2 significant, +3 defining)
