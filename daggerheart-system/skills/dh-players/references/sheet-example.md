## Experiences

### Experience: Shield Bearer of the Iron Watch

**Modifier**: +2

**Narrative Origin**: Ten years serving in the Iron Watch, the elite dwarven guard corps
> I trained every day with shield and hammer, protecting the High Gate from all threats. The Watch drilled us in formation fighting until it became instinct.

**Applies When**:
- Defending an ally or position
- Shield-based combat maneuvers (shield bash, blocking)
- Recognizing military tactics or formations
- Maintaining composure under pressure in battle

**Does NOT Apply**:
- Offensive attacks when not defending
- Social situations outside military contexts
- Stealth or subtlety (the Watch fights openly)
- Knowledge of magic or arcane matters

---

### Experience: Stonemason's Apprentice

**Modifier**: +1

**Narrative Origin**: Before joining the Watch, I apprenticed to my uncle in the mason's guild
> I learned to read stone, find its flaws, and shape it with patience. Good masonry is about understanding structure.

**Applies When**:
- Evaluating structural integrity of buildings or tunnels
- Working with stone, recognizing stone types
- Finding hidden passages in stonework
- Patience-based tasks requiring steady hands

**Does NOT Apply**:
- Combat situations
- Metalwork or woodwork
- Natural caves (focus was on constructed stonework)
- Artistic evaluation (I was a builder, not an artist)

## Class Features

**Guardian's Protection** (Level 1)
When an ally within Close range would take damage, you can spend 1 Hope to reduce the damage they take by your Armor Score. You can do this after damage is rolled but before HP is marked.

**Sentinel's Mark** (Level 1)
When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you can mark them until the end of your next turn. While marked, they have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.

**Bulwark** (Level 1)
While wielding a shield, increase your Evasion by 2. (Note: Combat Stats show base Evasion of 9. With Bulwark active while wielding shield, effective Evasion is 11.)

## Subclass Features

**Subclass**: None (chosen at Level 2)

---

## Ancestry Features

**Ancestry**: Dwarf

**Stoneblood**
You have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.

**Darkvision**
You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

---

## Community Feature

**Community**: Orderborne

**Disciplined Formation**
When you and at least one ally are adjacent to each other, you both gain +1 to Evasion. This bonus does not stack if multiple allies are adjacent.

## Notes

### Appearance
Bron is a stocky dwarf with gray-streaked auburn hair kept in tight braids. His beard is similarly braided and adorned with small iron rings marking his years in the Watch. A prominent scar runs across his left eyebrow from a training accident. He moves with the measured gait of someone used to heavy armor.

### Personality
Patient and steady, Bron rarely raises his voice. He believes in duty, order, and protecting those who cannot protect themselves. He can be inflexible about rules and protocol, which sometimes causes friction with more creative companions.

### Goals
Bron seeks to establish a new chapter of the Iron Watch in the surface lands. The old kingdom is fading, and he believes their traditions of protection should spread to those who need defenders.

### Backstory
For ten years, Bron served the Iron Watch at the High Gate, the primary entrance to the dwarven kingdom of Ironhold. When a cave-in sealed the Gate during a goblin siege, Bron and a small group held the rubble line for three days until reinforcements could dig through. He was the only survivor of his shield-line.

The kingdom council awarded him an honorable discharge and the Ashward title (granted to those who hold until only ash remains). But Bron felt hollow returning to peacetime duty. He left Ironhold to find a new purpose, carrying his shield and the memory of his fallen brothers.
