# Encounter Building Guide

Build balanced Daggerheart encounters using the Battle Points system. This guide provides the core formula, adversary costs, and adjustments for various situations.

---

## The Battle Points Formula

Calculate your encounter budget with this formula:

**Battle Points = (3 x Number of PCs) + 2**

| Party Size | Battle Points |
|------------|---------------|
| 2 PCs | 8 BP |
| 3 PCs | 11 BP |
| 4 PCs | 14 BP |
| 5 PCs | 17 BP |
| 6 PCs | 20 BP |

This produces a **standard difficulty** encounter: challenging but not deadly for a fresh party.

## Adversary Battle Point Costs

### By Type

| Adversary Type | Battle Points | Notes |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Minion | 1 | Expendable, low HP |
| Standard | 2-3 | Baseline threat (2 for Tier 1, 3 for Tier 2+) |
| Ranged | 2-3 | Same as Standard |
| Skulk | 2-3 | Same as Standard |
| Support | 2-3 | Same as Standard |
| Bruiser | 3-4 | Higher damage and HP |
| Horde | 3-5 | Group of weaker creatures |
| Leader | 4-5 | Force multiplier |
| Solo | Party BP | Designed for solo boss fights |
| Social | 1-2 | Non-combat focused |

### By Tier

Adjust Battle Point cost by Tier:

| Tier | Multiplier | Standard BP | Bruiser BP | Leader BP |
|------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | x1.0 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 2 | x1.5 | 3 | 4-5 | 5-6 |
| 3 | x2.0 | 4 | 6 | 8 |
| 4 | x2.5 | 5 | 7-8 | 10 |

## Encounter Difficulty Adjustments

### Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | BP Modifier | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Trivial | -50% | Warmup, no real threat |
| Easy | -25% | Minor challenge, low resource drain |
| Standard | 0% | Balanced, appropriate challenge |
| Hard | +25% | Significant challenge, resource drain |
| Deadly | +50% | Major threat, potential deaths |

**Example for 4 PCs (base 14 BP):**
- Trivial: 7 BP
- Easy: 10-11 BP
- Standard: 14 BP
- Hard: 17-18 BP
- Deadly: 21 BP

### Situational Modifiers

Adjust Battle Points based on circumstances:

| Situation | Adjustment | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Party is fresh (full HP/Hope) | +25% | Can handle more |
| Party is depleted (low HP/Hope) | -25% to -50% | Already weakened |
| Party has tactical advantage | +25% | Ambush, high ground |
| Adversaries have advantage | -25% | Surprise, terrain |
| Constrained environment | -10% | Fewer escape options |
| Open environment | +10% | More tactical options |
| Party has appropriate tools | +15% | Right damage types, etc. |
| Adversaries exploit weakness | -15% | Resistance mismatch |

## Encounter Composition Guidelines

### Action Economy Principle

Daggerheart's spotlight flow means action economy is less predictable than in turn-based systems. However, having more active adversaries still increases pressure.

**General Guidelines:**
- 1 adversary per PC is a baseline
- Fewer strong adversaries create focused fights
- More weak adversaries create chaotic fights
- Mix types for interesting tactical decisions

### Recommended Compositions

#### Single Boss (Solo Encounter)

- 1x Solo adversary (equals party BP)
- Optional: 2-4 Minions for action economy

**Best for:** Dramatic showdowns, climactic battles

#### Elite Squad

- 1x Leader (4-5 BP)
- 2-3x Standard/Bruiser (6-9 BP)

**Best for:** Organized threats, military encounters

#### Swarm

- 4-6x Minions (4-6 BP)
- 1-2x Standard (2-4 BP)
- Optional: 1x Support (2-3 BP)

**Best for:** Overwhelm scenarios, horror themes

#### Ambush Team

- 2x Skulk (4-6 BP)
- 1x Ranged (2-3 BP)
- 2x Minion (2 BP)

**Best for:** Trap encounters, bandit-style fights

#### Defensive Formation

- 1x Support (2-3 BP)
- 2x Bruiser (6-8 BP)
- 1x Ranged (2-3 BP)

**Best for:** Guarded locations, fortified positions

## Encounter Building Checklist

### Step 1: Calculate Budget

```
Party Size: ___
Base BP: (3 x ___) + 2 = ___
Difficulty: ___ (modifier: ___%)
Final BP Budget: ___
```

### Step 2: Choose Theme

What's the encounter about?
- [ ] Combat challenge
- [ ] Resource drain
- [ ] Narrative moment
- [ ] Teaching a mechanic

### Step 3: Select Adversaries

| Adversary | Type | Tier | BP Cost |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| **Total** | | | |

### Step 4: Verify Balance

- [ ] Total BP is within budget
- [ ] Action economy is reasonable (not too many or too few adversaries)
- [ ] Types create tactical variety
- [ ] At least one adversary has Fear Features for dramatic moments

### Step 5: Consider the Environment

- [ ] Terrain features that affect combat
- [ ] Lighting and visibility
- [ ] Escape routes (for both sides)

## Special Considerations

### Multi-Wave Encounters

For encounters with reinforcements:

1. Budget for total adversaries across all waves
2. First wave should be ~60% of budget
3. Subsequent waves add remaining BP
4. Consider that party will be depleted between waves

### Chase Encounters

For pursuit scenarios:

1. Use lower BP budget (party focused on running)
2. Include fast adversaries (Skulk, Ranged)
3. Environment becomes primary challenge
4. Combat should be brief and intense

### Social-Combat Hybrid

When combat might be avoided:

1. Include Social-type adversaries
2. Provide clear de-escalation paths
3. Combat should feel like a consequence, not the point
4. Budget for "backup" that arrives if things go badly

---

## Adjusting Mid-Encounter

If the encounter is too easy:
- Have adversaries use more aggressive tactics
- Introduce Fear Features more frequently
- Bring in reinforcements (pre-planned)

If the encounter is too hard:
- Have adversaries make tactical mistakes
- Reduce incoming Fear Features
- Create escape opportunities
- Introduce environmental advantages for players
