## The Battle Points Formula

Calculate your encounter budget with this formula:

**Battle Points = (3 x Number of PCs) + 2**

| Party Size | Battle Points |
|------------|---------------|
| 2 PCs | 8 BP |
| 3 PCs | 11 BP |
| 4 PCs | 14 BP |
| 5 PCs | 17 BP |
| 6 PCs | 20 BP |

This produces a **standard difficulty** encounter.

## Adversary Battle Point Costs (SRD)

| Battle Points | Adversary Type |
|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Group of Minions equal to party size |
| 1 | Social or Support |
| 2 | Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or Standard |
| 3 | Leader |
| 4 | Bruiser |
| 5 | Solo |

---

## Encounter Adjustments (SRD)

Apply these modifiers to your base Battle Points:

| Adjustment | Condition |
|------------|-----------|
| -1 | Easier or shorter fight |
| -2 | Using 2+ Solo adversaries |
| -2 | Adding +1d4 (or static +2) to all adversary damage |
| +1 | Adversary from a lower tier |
| +1 | No Bruisers, Hordes, Leaders, or Solos |
| +2 | Harder or longer fight |

## Encounter Composition Guidelines

### Action Economy Principle

Daggerheart's spotlight flow means action economy is less predictable than in turn-based systems. However, having more active adversaries still increases pressure.

**General Guidelines:**
- 1 adversary per PC is a baseline
- Fewer strong adversaries create focused fights
- More weak adversaries create chaotic fights
- Mix types for interesting tactical decisions

### Recommended Compositions

#### Single Boss (Solo Encounter)

- 1x Solo adversary (5 BP)
- Optional: 1 group of Minions (1 BP)

**Best for:** Dramatic showdowns, climactic battles

#### Elite Squad

- 1x Leader (3 BP)
- 2-3x Standard (4-6 BP)

**Best for:** Organized threats, military encounters

#### Swarm

- 1-2x Minion groups (1-2 BP)
- 1-2x Standard (2-4 BP)
- Optional: 1x Support (1 BP)

**Best for:** Overwhelm scenarios, horror themes

#### Ambush Team

- 2x Skulk (4 BP)
- 1x Ranged (2 BP)
- 1x Minion group (1 BP)

**Best for:** Trap encounters, bandit-style fights

#### Defensive Formation

- 1x Support (1 BP)
- 2x Bruiser (8 BP)
- 1x Ranged (2 BP)

**Best for:** Guarded locations, fortified positions

## Encounter Building Checklist

### Step 1: Calculate Budget

```
Party Size: ___
Base BP: (3 x ___) + 2 = ___
Difficulty: ___ (modifier: ___%)
Final BP Budget: ___
```

### Step 2: Choose Theme

What's the encounter about?
- [ ] Combat challenge
- [ ] Resource drain
- [ ] Narrative moment
- [ ] Teaching a mechanic

### Step 3: Select Adversaries

| Adversary | Type | Tier | BP Cost |
|-----------|------|------|---------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| **Total** | | | |

### Step 4: Verify Balance

- [ ] Total BP is within budget
- [ ] Action economy is reasonable (not too many or too few adversaries)
- [ ] Types create tactical variety
- [ ] At least one adversary has Fear Features for dramatic moments

### Step 5: Consider the Environment

- [ ] Terrain features that affect combat
- [ ] Lighting and visibility

## Example Encounters

### Road Ambush (4 PCs, Standard)

**Budget:** 14 BP

| Adversary | Type | BP |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Blighted Bandit | Standard | 2 |
| Blighted Bandit | Standard | 2 |
| Blighted Bandit Scout | Skulk | 2 |
| Blighted Minions (x4) | Minion | 1 |
| Blighted Bandit Leader | Leader | 3 |
| **Total** | | **10** |

*+2 adjustment for harder fight = 12 BP target*

**Tactics:** Scout triggers ambush, Minions engage front-line, Bandits throw daggers then close, Leader rallies and coordinates.

### Cave Horror (3 PCs, Hard)

**Budget:** 13 BP (11 base + 2 for harder fight)

| Adversary | Type | BP |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Cavern Lurker | Bruiser | 4 |
| Cave Spider | Standard | 2 |
| Cave Spider | Standard | 2 |
| Spider Swarm | Horde | 2 |
| **Total** | | **10** |

*+1 adjustment (lower tier adversaries) = 11 BP target*

**Tactics:** Lurker blocks exit, Spiders flank, Swarm harasses casters.

### Temple Guardian (4 PCs, Deadly)

**Budget:** 16 BP (14 base + 2 for harder fight)

| Adversary | Type | BP |
|-----------|------|-----|
| Sanctified Golem | Solo | 5 |
| Temple Acolyte | Support | 1 |
| Temple Acolyte | Support | 1 |
| Temple Acolyte | Support | 1 |
| Hallowed Soldier (x4) | Minion | 1 |
| **Total** | | **9** |

*+2 adjustment for harder fight = 11 BP target. This is a hard encounter despite lower BP due to Solo's multiple actions.*

**Tactics:** Golem dominates center, Acolytes heal and buff from flanks, Soldiers absorb attacks.

## Special Considerations

### Multi-Wave Encounters

For encounters with reinforcements:

1. Budget for total adversaries across all waves
2. First wave should be ~60% of budget
3. Subsequent waves add remaining BP
4. Consider that party will be depleted between waves

### Chase Encounters

For pursuit scenarios:

1. Use lower BP budget (party focused on running)
2. Include fast adversaries (Skulk, Ranged)
3. Environment becomes primary challenge
4. Combat should be brief and intense

### Social-Combat Hybrid

When combat might be avoided:

1. Include Social-type adversaries
2. Provide clear de-escalation paths
3. Combat should feel like a consequence, not the point
4. Budget for "backup" that arrives if things go badly

---

## Adjusting Mid-Encounter

If the encounter is too easy:
- Have adversaries use more aggressive tactics
- Introduce Fear Features more frequently
- Bring in reinforcements (pre-planned)

If the encounter is too hard:
- Have adversaries make tactical mistakes
- Reduce incoming Fear Features
- Create escape opportunities
- Introduce environmental advantages for players
