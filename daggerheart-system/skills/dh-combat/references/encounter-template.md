## Visual Token Notation Guide

Use filled (●) and empty (○) circles for quick visual scanning:

```
HP:     ●●●○○○ = 3 of 6 marked (3 damage taken)
Stress: ●○○○○○ = 1 of 6 marked
Hope:   ●●●●○○ = 4 of 6 tokens
Fear:   ●●●●●●●○○○○○ = 7 of 12 tokens
Armor:  ●●○ = 2 of 3 slots used
```

When updating:
- Mark damage by filling circles left to right
- Clear healing by emptying circles right to left
- At maximum (all filled), note any overflow/consequences
